Project Description
This program helps to detect and handle double-click issues, particularly for Logitech mice that may produce unwanted rapid double-clicks.

What it does:
Monitors mouse clicks and records the timing of each click.

Detects if two clicks happen too quickly (within a specified interval, e.g., 200 milliseconds).

When a possible double-click is detected, it can block or ignore the second click to prevent unintended double-click behavior.

Provides a simple Tkinter interface that allows the user to enable or disable the double-click blocking feature easily.

This tool is useful for users experiencing hardware issues with their mouse generating accidental double clicks and want a software workaround.Project Description
